## Class Overview

**We are here to learn Python**.

This website is called: **[https://taq.website/PYTH127](https://taq.website/PYTH1214)** -- please bookmark it! It will serve as your source of truth going forward.

### First Day Survey

ðŸ¤©ðŸ¤©
Tell us about yourself [here]()

### Website Walkthrough

Why don't we spend a few minutes walking through this website and the features it provides.

## Class Rituals

Here are some class rituals to be aware of.

### Slack

We will use slack for **all** communications. If you don't mind, please do not email me! If all comms are in slack, it is easier for us to prioritize and ensure we get back to you in a reasonable time frame.

Do note that slack is for real time communication. If there are any output artifacts (psets, docs, etc), they will all live in the class website. If something is a candidate for saving, please flag and we can post it to the website. Bringing this up because our slack workspace is free and eventually we will lose history.

#### Chans

* #general: for announcements, primarily. Please refrain from posting here (intended to be used by me)
* #questions: this is your space! Ask away! Any questions you may have related to content is fair game.
* #intros: pls introduce yourself! and feel free to comment/interact
* #random: watercooler stuff, share cool things/etc.

#### Etiquette

Generally speaking, try to reply in threads. So for example, if Person A posts a question, all discussion ought to happen in thread. This keeps clutter minimal and makes it easier for us to find stuff down the line.

Reactions are encouraged! During class, I might take the "room temperature" by soliciting reactions. As such, **please keep slack available and open** during lecture!

DMs: feel free to DM me for any question you have. Ideally, questions about content should be in #questions chan (unless you don't feel comfortable). Things specific to your situation or more private ought to be DM'd directly. Again, please CC the both of us - this increases the likelihood that we get back to you faster!

### Attendance

At the start of every class, you will be asked to fill out a form to **check-in** to class. This form will require a **token** that will be communicated to you verbally via Zoom. This ensures that whoever checked in was at least present in the beginning of class.

The link for attendance check-in will be posted to the *#general* channel in Slack at the beginning of every class. 

### Questions/Feedback

Feedback is a **key** part of this course. At the end of every lecture, we will ask you to fill out an **[exit ticket]()** (also available via the quick links section on class homepage).

Feedback and also questions are paramount to our success as a class and your success in learning to code. Please don't be shy! If you feel comfortable, pleaes ask your question on the Slack *#questions* channel. Otherwise, please DM me directly for specific/personal questions.

### PSETs/Practice

Practicing is the **ONLY** way to effectively learn to code. Full Stop.

As a result, I have _lots_ of practice problems available for you to try. Please find them in the quick links section of the class homepage. We will complete these during class. You have the option to complete any extras on your own time if you desire.

### Homework

There will be no official homework assigned. The only assignments will be to complete any outstanding practice problems from the day's class and to work on the final project.

### Zoom

Please edit your Zoom name to include your first name and if possible, profile picture.

You are encouraged to ask questions on Slack, I will pick up the question and optionally cover with the entire class or, if specific enough, just reply back to you with an answer.

Also, when we do in-class exercises, we will split into "breakout rooms" where you will be paired with folks 1-2 of your class mates. I will pop in and out of these rooms in order to ensure you are staying on track and any specific questions that you may have are answered. If you would like to flag our attention, please @-msg me on Slack!

## Tools

Primarily, we will be using **[Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/welcome.ipynb)** to write and operate our code.

**Please ensure that you give edit access to all your Colab notebooks to me** so that I can assist you and give feedback.

### Browser

It is strongly recommended that you use [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) for this class.

### Notes Organization

At the start of each day, please open a brand new Colab notebook. You will take all your notes in this notebook. I will walk through the content from the site in my own Colab notebook. The webpages about the content are for you to go back and reference later if you wish.

In the daily pset workbook, if you click "View" in the menu and then "Table of Contents", a left-side menu will appear with quick-links to the different sections of your Colab notebook.
